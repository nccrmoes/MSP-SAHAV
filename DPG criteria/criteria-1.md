The Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) platform for Puducherry aims to provide free and open access to geospatial datasets, supporting evidence-driven decision-making for sustainable marine and coastal resource management. By leveraging geospatial analysis and data-driven approaches, the platform facilitates informed policy-making and coordinated actions among stakeholders involved in marine conservation, fisheries management, coastal infrastructure development, and climate adaptation strategies.

## The platform plays a critical role in:

- **Sustainable marine resource utilization**, ensuring optimal use of coastal and ocean spaces while preserving biodiversity.
- **Climate resilience and adaptation**, integrating real-time environmental data to mitigate risks from sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and habitat degradation.
- **Infrastructure planning**, aiding the development of climate-resilient ports, coastal cities, and marine tourism.
- **Reducing conflicts between marine industries** such as fisheries, tourism, shipping, and conservation efforts by providing data-driven insights for spatial planning.

By combining scientific research, community knowledge, and digital innovations, the MSP platform ensures that marine governance aligns with sustainable development principles, leading to better resource management, disaster risk reduction, and economic benefits for coastal communities.

## Contribution to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

The MSP platform contributes to three SDG goals, namely:

- **Goal 14**: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development.
- **Goal 13**: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
- **Goal 15**: Protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.
- **Goal 9**: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation.
- **Goal 11**: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.

### The specific targets and indicators that the platform contributes to are detailed below:
