# Is ownership clearly defined?

The Marine Spatial Planning Database is developed and maintained by the **National Centre for Coastal Research**, in partnership with **Puducherry government agencies, research institutions, and conservation bodies**.

The ownership details, including **copyright, trademarks, and governance policies**, are publicly documented [here](https://www.nccr.gov.in/sites/default/files/th14feb23.pdf). The database follows an **inclusive governance model** to ensure broad stakeholder participation and accountability.
