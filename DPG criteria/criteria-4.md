# Platform Independence?

The MSP database is built entirely on **open-source technologies**, ensuring platform independence and interoperability. Key features include:

## **Use of Open-Source Tools**:
- **GeoServer** for serving geospatial data via standard protocols (**WMS, WFS**).
- **Leaflet.js** for interactive, web-based mapping.

## **Cross-Platform Accessibility**
- Compatible with various operating systems.
- Can be deployed on **cloud, on-premises, or hybrid environments** without dependency on proprietary software.

## **Modular Architecture**
- Allows integration with other **digital public goods** and government databases with minimal configuration changes.

## **Open Alternatives**
- All dependencies are **open-source**, and the system is designed to function without proprietary software. For example:
  - Proprietary GIS software can be replaced with **QGIS**, an open-source alternative.
  - Cloud hosting can be done on any platform supporting **Docker containers**, such as **AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure**.

This design ensures that the MSP database can be deployed and operated in diverse environments, from **low-resource settings** to **high-performance computing clusters**.
