# Does this project collect or use non-personally identifiable information (non-PII) data?

The MSP database is designed to facilitate the extraction and sharing of **non-PII data** in open, non-proprietary formats. Users can export data in the following formats:

- **Json**: For Chart data.
- **GeoJSON**: For geospatial data.
- **Shapefiles**: For compatibility with GIS software.
- **Raster files**: For compatibility with GIS software.


This flexibility ensures that the data can be easily integrated into other systems and workflows, **promoting interoperability and reuse**.
