    "about": "Puducherry is a Union Territory of India. Historically known as Pondicherry, the territory changed its official name to Puducherry in September 2006 which signifies new settlement or new town. Puducherry lies in the southern part of the Indian Peninsular. The Union Territory of Puducherry is extending over an area of 490 Sq.Kms. The U.T of Puducherry consists of two revenue districts viz., Puducherry District comprising of Puducherry, Mahe and Yanam regions and Karaikal District comprising of Karaikal region. Puducherry region is the largest urban agglomeration of all the three regions, occupies an area of 294 km2, lies on the east-coast of southern India, and consists of 12 scattered areas lying in between 11° 46’ and 12° 30’ of north latitude and between 79° 36’ and 79° 53’ of east longitude. Yanam region is lies in the east of Southern India, an area of 8.76 km2 and Mahe region is lies in the Western coast of southern India, an area of 30 km2. All four regions of Puducherry U.T. are located in the coastal region.<br/><br/>There are 5 Municipalities, 10 Commune Panchayats, 8 Taluks and 3 Community Development Blocks. There are 129 Revenue villages (Puducherry -81, Karaikal -37, Mahe -5 and Yanam -6). Puducherry and Karaikal regions are classified into both urban and rural areas whereas entire Mahe and Yanam regions are classified as urban area. Five rivers in Puducherry region, seven in Karaikal, two in Mahe and one in Yanam drain into the sea, but none originates within the territory. Fishermen, in 39 marine fishing villages and 11 inland fishing villages are actively engaged in fishing. The Puducherry region has as interesting cross cultural history and its built form lends a unique identity to the city. The old part of Pondicherry is known as the Boulevard Town since it is bounded by four boulevards that constituted the outer limits of the city’s fortification. The Boulevard Town presents two distinct architectural styles in the Tamil and French quarters, which are separated by a canal and unified by a rectilinear grid plan. The four regions of the Union Territory have a coast line of 45 km.",

Majority of the litter types were various forms (bottles, caps, ropes, food wrappers, etc.) and types of plastics (polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene, etc.). Fishing nets and ropes were found in more numbers. Around 9.3 tons of litters were collected in total over the surveyed area. <br/><br/>A marine outfall is a pipeline or tunnel that discharges municipal or industrial wastewater, storm water, combined sewer overflows, cooling water, or brine effluents from water desalination plants to the sea.
