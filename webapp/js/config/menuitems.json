    "about": "Coastal inundation caused by various natural hazards such as cyclones, storms, tsunamis, and floods depends on the coastal elevation and slope. However, the inundation level  varies depending on the intensity of the hazard. The primary objective of Coastal Inundation Risk Mapping (CIRM) is to identify and mitigate the areas which are potentially at higher risk. This map is based on the risk of low-lying coastal areas exposed to coastal flooding on extreme water levels with respect to the multi-hazard line considering a 100-year return period. This also extended the scope towards approaching nature based and grey based protections. Further, the socio-economic data pertaining to each coastal village has been used to indicate the exposure to the inundation leading to a greater damage or risk.<br/><br/> Source: NCCR"
